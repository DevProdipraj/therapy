                  Highs and lows are a part of life, and life must go on. To
                  keep our lives going on, we need certain conflicts and issues
                  unaddressed. These issues remain under the surface until they
                  all pile up and become a mountain that then starts trying to
                  rupture our emotional skin and break out.At such moments,
                  people usually get puzzled and can't make sense of what is
                  happening to them as they lose track of their past issues. It
                  does not represent any emotional weakness or mental
                  instability. It is natural and happens everybody.Sometimes,
                  talking with your close friends and family members helps
                  suppress the issues and give you a break until they break out
                  again. And sometimes, it is just not enough.That is when you
                  need professional help like the one we offer. It would help if
                  you had an environment where you can talk to somebody who
                  listens, understands and can propose solutions in a non-
                  judgmental and private manner.
